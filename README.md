# advent-of-code-2018
My solutions for the Advent of Code 2018 Challenge.

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles. Throughout the month of December, two puzzles will be made available on each day in the advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star.

I used Java, Maven and JUnit as basic tools for providing solutions for these challenges.
